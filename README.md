# Computer-Vision-Python

Implementation of basic concepts of computer vision and image processing using the OpenCV library and python.

The following topics are included or are going to be updated in here :
1. Fundamentals : Histograms, grascaling, etc..
2. Image Manipulations : affine and non-affine transforms,edge detection, filters, dilation and erosion and image gradients.
3. Image segmentation : Contours, convex hull, circle detection and line detection.
4. Object Detection : SIFT, SURF, FAST, BRIEF and ORB and Histogram of Oriented Gradients.
5. Face, people and car Detection: HAAR cascade classifiers
6. Augmented Reality-Facial Landmark : Face analysis, filtering and face swaps.
7. Machine learning : hand-written digit classification and facial recognition.
8. Motion analysis and object tracking : Background and foreground subtraction,meanshift, CAMshift and optical flow.
